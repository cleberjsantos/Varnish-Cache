VCL Syntax
----------

VCL has inherited a lot from C and it reads much like simple C or Perl.

Blocks are delimited by curly braces, statements end with semicolons,
and comments may be written as in C, C++ or Perl according to your own
preferences.

Note that VCL doesn't contain any loops or jump statements.
