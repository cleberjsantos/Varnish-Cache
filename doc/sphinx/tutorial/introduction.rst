What is Varnish?
----------------

Varnish Cache is a web application accelerator. It can also be called
a HTTP reverse proxy. The next chapter :ref:`tutorial-web-accelerator`
will go into detail on what Varnish is.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

Varnish has a modern architecture and is written with performance in
mind.  It is usually bound by the speed of the network, effectivly
turning performance into a non-issue.

Flexibility
~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the key features of Varnish Cache, in addition to it's
performance, is the flexibility of it's configuration language,
VCL. VCL enables you to write policies on how incoming requests should
be handled. 

In such a policy you can decide what content you want to serve, from
where you want to get the content and how the request or response
should be altered. 

Supported plattforms
--------------------

Varnish is written to run on modern versions of Linux and FreeBSD and
the best experience is had on those plattforms. Thanks to our
contributors it also runs on NetBSD, OpenBSD and OS X.

About the Varnish development process
-------------------------------------

Varnish is a community driven project. The development is overseen by
the Varnish Governing Board which currently consist of Poul-Henning
Kamp (Architect), Rogier Mulhuijzen (Fastly) and Kristian Lyngst√∏l
(Varnish Software).
