The Varnish Tutorial
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

What is a tutorial, anyway?

Scope: Lets start off by explaining the basic concept. Cover the
following points:
- what is a cache. How does Varnish work?
- how do I start it.  

Then we hand things over to the user guide. 

Let's start off by including some of the  stuff we chucked out of the
previous tutorial - now "users guide"
